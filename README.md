# MapTP - Minecraft teleport plugin for servers using [GriefPrevention](https://github.com/TechFortress/GriefPrevention)

The plugin add new right click functionality to maps in item frames when used alongside [GriefPrevention](https://github.com/TechFortress/GriefPrevention).

Right click on a map to be teleported to the nearest claim you own to the map center. 

Once I actually make a release I'll figure out how to stick a badge here.

### Wiki

This is a to-do item. I'll put a little something there. But the plugin is pretty bare-bones as of now.

### See also

I'll add links to release threads whenever I figure out how to do that.

### Future Plans

I'll be improving the stability of the plugin to handle edge cases and things like proper error messages when players don't have any claims.
I will also be adding improvements like support for teleporting to unowned claims and better visualization like markers added to maps and 
TP effects.
